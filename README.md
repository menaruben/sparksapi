A (work in progress) League of Legends API for individual champion, item and runes stats/analytics
> ⚠️ This repository is a work in progress. I am also working on a web application using this api which will be published in another repo in the future.

If you have any suggestions for refactoring, features etc. please open an issue. :)

# infos
In order to run this you would need to have a riot API key which you can get [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/) for free.
Store it into an environment variable called `RIOT_API_KEY`
